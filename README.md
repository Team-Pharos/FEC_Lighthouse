## Getting Started

After cloning in the repository run `npm install` to install all dependencies. Then run `npm client-dev` to watch any changes made to the front-end and `npm server-dev` to work on the back-end.

**Access to prviously used API is not longer available. New inventory API would need to be used with refactoring necessary for data structuring!**
